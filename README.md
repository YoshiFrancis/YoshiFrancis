Hi, I’m Francis Ozua, a second year Computer Engineering student at Purdue University - West Lafayette.

Currently, I am working on a game called Brawlmon using the Godot game engine. I started in November and hope to finish by the beginning of May. This is my first game, so I do not fully know how to judge the timeline!

Overall, my interests have leaned more toward the systems side of computing, with an increasing interest in computer architecture as well. Within the next two semesters of college, I will have taken the operating systems, computer networking, computer architecture, and compilers courses offered to me. With those being learned, I will have hoped to learn much about the internals of a computer and hopefully how to apply that knowledge.

My main languages are Go and C++. I have made a couple of projects, mainly involving games or a game hub server utilizing web sockets. I have not made anything much further due to my laziness ;(.
