        <img src="../Yoshi Pictures/yoshi.pictures/yoshi.jpg">
        <p><strong>Yoshi</strong> is a dinosaur-like character that acts as an ally of Mario and Luigi and is the protagonist of his own franchise. Among members of the Yoshi species hailing from Yoshi's Island, any Yoshi may be identified as the "Yoshi" character, and as such, not all iterations of the character are necessarily the same one. According to the Super Mario World manual, he got his name from Yoshi's Island because he was first discovered there.[1] Yoshi managed to rescue and protect Baby Mario and Baby Luigi from Kamek and the Koopa Troop. In the Super Mario series, he often acts as a rideable character for the heroes, while in most of the spin-offs, he is a playable character on his own. Yoshi's defining traits include his cutesy appearance, his cheerful and friendly personality, his flutter-jumping and egg-laying abilities, his rideability as a steed, and exclaiming his own name.

            <br>
            Mario is the main character and protagonist of the long-running and highly successful Mario franchise. He was created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto and serves as the main mascot of Nintendo. Mario made his first appearance as the protagonist of the arcade game Donkey Kong, released in 1981 (in which he took the alias "Jumpman"). Since Super Mario Bros., his trademark abilities have been his jumping and stomping powers, with which he defeats most of his enemies, and his ability to gain even more powers with a plethora of items, such as the Super Mushroom, the Fire Flower, and the Super Star. Games have usually portrayed Mario as a silent character without a distinct personality (Fortune Street is a notable exception). According to Nintendo's philosophy, this allows Mario to fit in many different genres and roles. In most games, he is the hero that goes on an adventure to save Princess Peach from his arch-nemesis, Bowser, but he has been shown doing many other activities besides adventuring, such as racing and sporting with his younger twin brother, Luigi, and others. Mario's main traits are his red hat, thick mustache, Italian accent, cheerful personality, heavy use of power-ups, and high jumping ability.

          <br>
          Luigi is Mario's slightly younger, taller fraternal twin brother and the deuteragonist of the Mario franchise. Throughout his life, he has lived in Mario's shadow, developing both cowardly and heroic tendencies. Despite this, Luigi has helped and fought alongside his brother on many occasions. Mario Bros. marks his first appearance in the Mario franchise and his debut in general. Originally an exact copy, then palette swap of Mario, Luigi was created to facilitate a second-player option. Since the two-player mode was dropped from most main Super Mario games beginning with Super Mario Land, Luigi has gained his own identity and personality, becoming a co-starring character of the Mario franchise. This is especially noticeable in installments for the Luigi's Mansion and the Mario & Luigi series of games. Luigi's notable traits include his green cap, his smooth mustache, his cowardly personality, his Italian accent, his heavy use of power-ups, and a superior jumping ability to Mario.

          <br>
          Princess Peach (casually Peach, usually known as Princess Toadstool outside of Japan prior to Super Mario 64) is a main character in the Mario franchise and the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach first appeared in Super Mario Bros. and was created by Shigeru Miyamoto to be the damsel-in-distress throughout most Mario games. She resides in her castle along with many Toads, who act as her loyal servants. Her kingdom is often attacked by the Koopa Troop, a group led by Bowser. She is the love interest of Mario.

Peach has an affinity for the color pink, which accents her gentle personality and kind temperament. Peach's gentle nature and role as the damsel are often represented with her heart abilities and crown emblem. Peach's initial design was said to represent her stubborn yet cute appearance.[4][dead link]

Since her debut, Peach has appeared in installments related to the Mario game series for over three decades. Peach is occasionally a supporting character in mainstream games and almost always playable in spin-off installments. Her most prominent appearance to date is as the heroine of Super Princess Peach and the most recent mainstream game where she appears as a playable character rather than a damsel-in-distress is Super Mario 3D World.

          Rosalina is a recurring character that debuted in Super Mario Galaxy, first appearing in the Gateway Galaxy. She is a very powerful figure, as her duty is to watch over and protect the cosmos, while also serving as the adopted mother of the Lumas and commanding the Comet Observatory.

Rosalina's backstory is chronicled in her storybook told by her in the Comet Observatory's Library in Super Mario Galaxy. Nine chapters are unlocked throughout the game, and the last is unlocked by completing the game.

          —Princess Daisy, Fortune Street</br></br>
Princess Daisy, or casually Daisy, is the princess of Sarasaland and a recurring character in the Mario franchise. She is a tomboy, which is something first stated in her debut appearance, Super Mario Land.[1] Her name, attire, emblems, and special abilities are often flower-based.

          Bowser, sometimes known as King Koopa or King Bowser (Japanese: 大魔王クッパ, Daimaō Kuppa, which translates into "Great Demon King Koopa" or "Great Sorcerer King Koopa," the latter being used in the manual of Super Mario Bros.[1]) and more recently referred to by his minions as Lord Bowser or Master Bowser (Japanese: クッパさま Kuppa-sama), is a major character and the main antagonist of the Mario franchise. He is a large, powerful, fire-breathing Koopa who leads the Koopa Troop, an antagonistic organization of turtle-like creatures, and has been the arch-nemesis of Mario since his debut in Super Mario Bros. He has repeatedly kidnapped or attempted to kidnap Princess Peach with the ultimate goal of defeating Mario and taking over the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser's defining traits are his monstrous appearance with dragon-like elements, full-throated roar, fire-breathing abilities, cruel personality, bestial reptilian voice, never-ending conflict with Mario, and unrequited crush for Peach.

        <dd>
          <img src="../Yoshi Pictures/description.pictures/koopalings.jpg">
          <br>
          The Koopalings (Japanese: コクッパ Kokuppa; alternatively クッパ7人衆 Kuppa Shichi Ninshū, "Team of 7 Bowsers"), also known as Bowser's Minions (クッパの手下 Kuppa no Teshita) in Japanese and the British English localizations of some games, and in certain American works as the Koopa Kids, are a seven-member clan of recurring enemies in the Mario franchise, portrayed as siblings who act as leaders of the Koopa Troop under Bowser. Individually, they are named Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Roy, Lemmy, and Ludwig. Although Bowser Jr. is not a member of the Koopalings, they sometimes act as his personal minions.

The Koopalings debuted in Super Mario Bros. 3, and later appeared as bosses in various SNES-era Mario games before going on a long hiatus, reappearing once in 2003's Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, and then being redesigned for 2009's New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which has since been followed by numerous appearances as both bosses in the Super Mario platformers and playable characters in various spinoffs. They have also appeared in various other media, including the cartoon The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, which featured entirely different names for the characters due to them not having official names at the time of its production phase.

Originally, the Koopalings were depicted as Bowser's children and stated to be his offspring. However, Shigeru Miyamoto eventually affirmed that Nintendo's "current story is that the Koopalings are not Bowser's children" in 2012, leaving the Koopalings as his underlings and Bowser Jr. as his only child.

          <br>
          Pauline (originally known as Lady or the Beautiful Girl) is the damsel-in-distress in the arcade game Donkey Kong, the installment that marked her debut in both the Donkey Kong and Mario franchises, along with Mario and her titular kidnapper (confirmed in later games to be a younger Cranky Kong). She was Mario's first love interest.

Pauline reprises her damsel-in-distress role in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series. In Super Mario Odyssey, she plays a prominent supporting role singing the theme song of the game, "Jump Up, Super Star!"

Pauline is stated by Game Over, a 1993 non-fiction book by David Sheff, to be named after Polly James, wife of Nintendo of America's warehouse manager, Don James, a fact later confirmed by Don James himself at Nintendo's E3 2018 Treehouse Live event.

          Donkey Kong, also known simply as DK, D.K., or D. Kong, is a major character in the Mario franchise and the main protagonist of the Donkey Kong franchise. A powerful, yet carefree Kong from Donkey Kong Island, Donkey Kong spends his days collecting bananas and spending time with his friends, particularly his best friend Diddy Kong. When trouble arises, Donkey Kong jumps headfirst into the action to help his friends and protect his island. However, he has also been portrayed as an antagonist on multiple occasions, such as in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series. Donkey Kong is the name of two Kongs; as of Donkey Kong Country, the original Donkey Kong is currently known as Cranky Kong, with the current Donkey Kong being Cranky's grandson and Donkey Kong Jr.'s son.

          <img src="../Yoshi Pictures/description.pictures/wario.jpg">
          <br>
          Wario is a recurring character in the Mario franchise, designed to be an arch-rival to Mario. He is a muscular, hot-tempered, and greedy character, usually playing the role of an anti-hero or an antagonist; he has also gone on to become a protagonist of his series of games, including the Wario Land titles and the WarioWare titles. His name is a combination of Mario's name and the Japanese word warui (悪い), meaning "bad."

Wario is a creation of Hiroji Kiyotake. Long-time Mario artist Yoichi Kotabe also helped with the character's final design. Wario's defining traits are his yellow cap and purple overalls; larger build and remarkable strength; unintelligence; gruff Italian accent; rude, reckless, and greedy personality; zigzag mustache (as well as other bizarre physical features); insatiable appetite for garlic; and rivalry with Mario. The WarioWare and Super Smash Bros. titles depict him in a biker outfit: a jean vest, yellow gloves, and an aviator hat with goggles.

Wario has two iconic vehicles usually seen in his series of titles: the Wario Car from the Wario Land series, and the Wario Bike in the WarioWare titles. In addition, he owns a plane called the Bulldog, which appears in Mario & Wario and Wario's Woods, among other titles. In Wario Land II and Wario World, he is depicted as owning his own castle. The WarioWare series of games depict him as owning a microgame-creating company called WarioWare, Inc. based in Diamond City. The popularity and success of his series of titles have made him have a designated series icon (the letter W) in the Super Smash Bros. series, set aside from other Mario characters.

          <br>
          Waluigi is Luigi's lanky rival and Wario's partner. Waluigi made his debut in Mario Tennis, and since then, he has made playable appearances exclusively in the Mario franchise's spin-off titles. He makes an appearance as a playable character in all but one game in the Mario Tennis series. He has been voiced by Charles Martinet ever since his debut. His name is a portmanteau of the Japanese words warui, meaning "bad", and Ruīji, meaning "Luigi."

Waluigi is defined by his purple attire, nasally Italian accent, long handlebar-esque mustache (and other bizarre physical features), rude and trickster personality, rivalry with Luigi, and tendency to cheat.

          <br>
          Baby Bowser, also known as Prince Bowser, Bowsie or Baby Koopa, is one of the two main antagonists in the Yoshi franchise, alongside Kamek. He was designed to be the infant self of Bowser. Kamek, although not biologically related to him, is mainly responsible for his child rearing. Baby Bowser looks almost identical to his future child, Bowser Jr., even sometimes using the same voice clips. The main difference in the visual design between the two is that Bowser Jr. has a drawing on his bandanna, while Baby Bowser's is blank, or he does not wear it at all.

Adult Bowser has been portrayed as an infant in other media, namely in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! episode Two Plumbers and a Baby and The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 episode Toddler Terrors of Time Travel, though the Baby Bowser character is considered a distinct entity from these forms.

          The Mario franchise is a collection of video game series by Nintendo. While Nintendo is usually their developer and publisher, various series are usually developed by other third-party companies, such as Hudson Soft and Intelligent Systems. The games primarily revolve around Mario, and usually involve the motif of Bowser kidnapping Princess Peach and Mario rescuing her. Various characters have different plots and goals that vary in each series; for example, the Luigi's Mansion series focuses on Luigi ridding his new mansion of ghosts, while Wario stars in games that center around his greed and desire for money and treasure.

Character roots begin with Donkey Kong where Mario, Donkey Kong, and Pauline originate. Designed by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto; they were built off the base of characters from Popeye. Unable to obtain licensing rights for the characters, Miyamoto made later changes to their appearances and personalities, such as making them more lighthearted in tone. Due to the critical and commercial success of Donkey Kong when it was released in July 1981, Mario would reappear in Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. in 1983 and 1985, respectively. Mario Bros. introduced Mario's fraternal twin Luigi, and Super Mario Bros. introduced Toad alongside numerous enemies, with Bowser and Princess Peach replacing both Donkey and Pauline.

Throughout each series of games, numerous characters have been introduced and have since become recurring. Some games, such as the Super Mario series, have supporting protagonists that aid the main character, such as Cappy from Super Mario Odyssey and Professor E. Gadd from the Luigi's Mansion series. Other main and supporting antagonists appear as an additional hindrance with minor roles, such as the Koopalings. The games all typically share common enemies.
